# Calculate Resistor
#### Video Demo:
- https://youtu.be/kuoQQObnxA4
#### Description:
- This project is a web-based application designed to help users calculate the resistance of a resistor based on the color bands. The application allows users to select the colors of the four bands on a resistor and provides an accurate calculation of the resistor’s value and tolerance.

Features:
- Color Selection: Users can select the colors of the four bands on the resistor from dropdown menus.
- Real-time Display: The selected colors are displayed on an image of the resistor, providing a visual representation.
- Resistance Calculation: The application calculates the resistance value based on the selected colors of the first three bands.
- Tolerance Calculation: The application also calculates the tolerance of the resistor based on the color of the fourth band.
- Reset Functionality: Users can reset the selection to the default state with a single click.

Technologies Used:
- HTML: For the structure of the web page.
- CSS and Bootstrap: For styling and layout.
- JavaScript: For the logic and functionality of the calculator.
